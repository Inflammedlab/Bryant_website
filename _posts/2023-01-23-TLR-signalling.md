We are studying the molecular mechanisms underlying how ligands, such as endotoxin, interact with TLR4/MD2 receptor complex to recruit their adaptor signalling molecules, such as Mal and Tram, to initiate intracellular signalling (in collaboration with Nick Gay, Biochemistry). 

##Approaches

We are using FRET analysis and single molecule florescence techniques to study how TLRs form active signalling protein complexes and recruit adaptor proteins in real-time in live cells (in collaboration with David Klenerman, Chemistry).  

Allergens, such as the cat dander protein Fel D1, are readily contaminated by endotoxin and this allows them to be detected by TLR4.  Prevention of host detection may prevent the onset of an allergic response. In particular we are interested in how allergens, such as the cat dander protein Fel d1 enhances TLR4 signalling and whether we can design inhibitors to prevent allergen recognition. 


## TLR in disease

 ### Alzheimer's disease
We are insterested in dissecting how amyloid beta and alpha synuclein, produced during diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s (respectively) can be recognised by TLR4 to induce inflammation. Our collaboratives projects with David Klenerman seek to understand the molecular basis by which host recognition of these proteins occurs. Our ultimate goal is to leverage this knowloadge to propose new treatments for these neuroinflammatory diseases.

We're exploring how the body recognizes harmful bacteria using a variety of techniques, and we're also investigating how certain proteins associated with chronic diseases like allergies and Alzheimer's can be detected by the body's recognition receptors.
