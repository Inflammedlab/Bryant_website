		<td><b>Dr. Joseph Boyle</b> I have been working for Clare since finishing my PhD. For most of this time I have been working in collaboration with Apollo Therapeutics to develop small molecule inhibitors of TLR4. My background is in biochemistry and bioinformatics but I am now mostly working on CRISPR-based research, especially on the TRIF pathway downstream of TLR4 signalling.</td>

		<td><b>Dr. Akhi Jha</b> I am a clinical lecturer in experimental and respiratory medicine at the University of Cambridge and am interested in the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of innate immune memory in the respiratory mucosa. I completed my PhD at the National Heart and Lung Institute under the supervision of Professor Peter Openshaw and Trevor Hansel. I developed in vivo nasal challenge models using toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists to study mechanistic immune pathways involved in respiratory infections, especially in dysregulated host responses such as in asthma. My goal is to translate an improved understanding of host immunity into developing effective therapies against respiratory infections and aim to collaborate with colleagues in the HIC-Vac network to achieve this.</td>

### Tomi
I am a second year PhD student investigating the toll-like receptor mediated inflammatory response in the context of neurogenerative diseases. I am interested in determining whether the disease-associated protein aggregate-induced activation of TLR4 results in priming through epigenetic changes. I completed my MSc in Neuroscience at the University of Nottingham and then went on to work for the NHS as a Medical Laboratory Assistant and then as a Research Technician at a UK DRI Care & Research Technology Centre (Imperial College). To keep myself occupied in my spare time, I work on STEM-focused EDI initiatives.
### Santiago

I am Santiago Caño-Muñiz a Postdoc at Bryant's Lab. Rise and educated in Madrid, I received my degree in Biology from the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid and my MSc in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology from the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. I investigate the infection process from the bacterial point of view. This work will help us to develop our understanding of bacterial attachment and host colonisation. I am also working on developing better methods for image analysis. Outside the lab, you can find me around my family or coding fun projects.
