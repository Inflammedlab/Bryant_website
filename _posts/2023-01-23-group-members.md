The beauty of computer programming is that you do not need to formally go to school to learn how to program. You can learn almost everything that you would need to know online, and for free. The following resources are some that I have used personally, that I highly recommend, for anyone looking to learn more about computer programming.

I have been working for Clare since finishing my PhD. For most of this time I have been working in collaboration with Apollo Therapeutics to develop small molecule inhibitors of TLR4. My background is in biochemistry and bioinformatics but I am now mostly working on CRISPR-based research, especially on the TRIF pathway downstream of TLR4 signalling.

### Tomi
I am a second year PhD student investigating the toll-like receptor mediated inflammatory response in the context of neurogenerative diseases. I am interested in determining whether the disease-associated protein aggregate-induced activation of TLR4 results in priming through epigenetic changes. I completed my MSc in Neuroscience at the University of Nottingham and then went on to work for the NHS as a Medical Laboratory Assistant and then as a Research Technician at a UK DRI Care & Research Technology Centre (Imperial College). To keep myself occupied in my spare time, I work on STEM-focused EDI initiatives.
### Santiago

I am Santiago Caño-Muñiz a Postdoc at Bryant's Lab. Rise and educated in Madrid, I received my degree in Biology from the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid and my MSc in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology from the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. I investigate the infection process from the bacterial point of view. This work will help us to develop our understanding of bacterial attachment and host colonisation. I am also working on developing better methods for image analysis. Outside the lab, you can find me around my family or coding fun projects.
