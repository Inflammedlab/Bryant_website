Successful collaborations with academia and industry underpins all our research.  We collaborate closely with academics in the USA, Europe and Australia to stay at the cutting edge of inflammation and infection research.  A vital part of our research is to forge, and maintain, strong collaborations with the pharmaceutical industry to translate our research into medicines.
